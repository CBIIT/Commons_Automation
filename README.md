# Commons\_Automation

This repository contains automated test scripts for **Data Commons** applications. It provides a cross-language automation framework designed to validate data accuracy and consistency between UI and backend reference files using **Groovy**, **Java**, **Python**, and **Selenium**.

---

## Overview

The framework automates the comparison of:

* **UI data** extracted via Katalon Studio and Selenium.
* **Reference data** loaded from TSV files using Python’s pandas library.

### Execution Flow

1. **Query File Input**

   * Test execution begins by reading an Excel file containing query definitions.

2. **UI Interaction**

   * Filters are applied using Selenium-based actions.
   * Resulting UI data is captured and saved to an output Excel file.

3. **Reference Data Load**

   * TSV source files are read into pandas DataFrames.
   * Data is processed and transformed according to the query schema.
   * Output is saved to a second Excel file.

4. **Data Comparison**

   * The two result sets are compared.
   * A test passes if all data matches; discrepancies result in test failure.
