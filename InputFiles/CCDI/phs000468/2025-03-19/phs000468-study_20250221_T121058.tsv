study	phs000468	phs000468	TARGET: Osteosarcoma (OS)	TARGET_OS	There are 93 fully characterized patient cases that make up the TARGET OS dataset, each with gene expression, tumor and paired normal copy number analyses, methylation, miRNA profiles, along with comprehensive next-generation sequencing to include mRNA-seq and exome sequencing (whole genome sequencing where available). There are additional cases with partial molecular characterization and/or sequencing data available, making this an informative genomic dataset.
