study	phs003519	phs003519	Single-Cell Atlas of NF1 Nerve Sheath Tumors	CCDI_NCI_phs003519	The worst outcome of NF1 is the development of the aggressive and highly metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), which transform from benign plexiform neurofibroma (PN) and lack effective treatment. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 63 clinically annotated NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors, including 24 PN, 34 premalignant atypical neurofibromas, and 5 MPNSTs. These results improve the ability of identifying high-risk neurofibromas and provide a unique opportunity for early detection of MPNST.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003519		Completed					CCDI released;dbGaP released;DCF indexed;Validated		2495f9a5-c40d-5daf-ad9b-d9af01ef40a7
