study	phs000470	phs000470	TARGET: Kidney, Rhabdoid Tumor (RT)	TARGET_RT	To further explore some more aggressive subtypes in pediatric cancer already under study in OCG, CGCI is partnering with TARGET initiative to support extensive sequencing analysis of three hard to treat childhood cancers: refractory to treatment cases of acute myeloid leukemia and two rare kidney tumors; clear cell sarcoma of the kidney and rhabdoid tumor (RT). Rhabdoid tumors are a rare, very aggressive type of kidney tumor of infancy, and patients typically have a poor prognosis. Up to 40 patient cases of matched tumor and normal samples, as well as some established cell lines, will undergo whole genome sequencing, miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq, DNA methyl-seq and ChIP-seq to generate a comprehensive profile and hopefully facilitate the development of better therapeutic options for this tumor subtype.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/sstr/report/phs000470		Completed					CCDI released;dbGaP released;Validated		8a1cf31c-96c4-5ce6-8b9c-73453f41f3d3
