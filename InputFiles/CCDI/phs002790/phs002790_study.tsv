The Molecular Characterization Initiative (MCI) will further the CCDI's goals by providing access to better diagnostic tests for pediatric and AYA patients. The molecular characterizations of solid tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and rare diseases are performed in a CLIA-certified setting as results may be used to screen for and/or confirm clinical trial eligibility, direct treatment, or otherwise contribute to the conduct of the trial.	phs002790	Clinical Trial Specimen Molecular Characterization (CTSMC)	Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI): Molecular Characterization Initiative		study
