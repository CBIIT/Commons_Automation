study	phs003111	phs003111	Clonal evolution during metastatic spread in high-risk neuroblastoma	CCDI_MSK_phs003111	Patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) frequently present with widely metastatic disease with tumors harboring recurrent MYCN, TERT and ATRX alterations. Most genomic studies to-date, however, have focused on single diagnostic samples. Consequently our understanding of the clonal and genetic evolution of disease progression and metastasis remains limited. We set out to deliver a detailed characterization of clonal architecture of HR-NB during disease evolution and identify the biological pathways important for progression. We studied 470 sequential and spatially separated samples from 283 patients. This particular dbGAP study contains data from 182 tumors from 68 individuals. For 30 individuals (72 tumors with WGS and 70 tumors with RNA-seq) raw WGS/RNA-seq data and somatic mutation calls are available. For 38 individuals (n=110 tumors) somatic mutation calls are available.			Completed					CCDI released;dbGaP released;DCF indexed;Validated		027e2441-7fbc-5a58-85a8-babe45f91de5
