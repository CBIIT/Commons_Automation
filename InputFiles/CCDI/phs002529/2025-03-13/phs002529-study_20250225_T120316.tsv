study	phs002529	phs002529	Comprehensive Genomic Sequencing of Pediatric Cancer Cases (CMRI/KUCC)	CCDI_KUMC_phs002529	This study provides paired tumor normal genomic sequencing data from ~ 200 children with cancer, including both solid tumors and leukemias, done by the Children's Mercy Research Institute (CMRI) and University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC). These data include whole genome sequencing (generally, ~20x), whole exome sequencing (generally, ~300x), bulk RNA sequencing (generally, ~80 million reads), and single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing (>50,000 reads/cell). Additional phenotypic, pathologic, and genetic data, gathered clinically for these samples, are also provided.	DS-CA	1			Completed			Genomic			41f958ca-160e-56c5-97e6-e7f3c7f90966
