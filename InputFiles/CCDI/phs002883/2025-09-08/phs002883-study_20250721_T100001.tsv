study	phs002883	phs002883	Pediatric Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice	PedMATCH	NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH is a cancer treatment clinical trial for children, teens, and young adults, aged 1 to 21 years, that is testing the use of precision medicine for childhood cancers. In this trial, young people with solid tumors that are not responding to treatment are assigned to an experimental treatment based on the genetic changes found in their tumors rather than on their type of cancer or cancer site. The genetic changes are found through genomic sequencing, which is a laboratory method used to determine the genetic makeup of cancer cells.	https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/clinical-trials/nci-supported/pediatric-match		Active					CCDI released;dbGaP released;DCF indexed;Validated		ec303fe3-0c90-5c79-b397-04db4b0ed823
