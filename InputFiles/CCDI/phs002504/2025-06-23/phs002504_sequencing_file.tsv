In brief, DNA was fragmented by sonication (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA) to 150 bp and further purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Fifty ng of size-selected DNA was then ligated to specific adaptors during library preparation (Illumina TruSeq, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Each library was made with sample-specific barcodes and quantified by quantitative PCR (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA), and two libraries were pooled to a total of 500 ng for exome enrichment using the Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit (Whole Exome_v1.1; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

Each library was made with sample-specific barcodes and quantified by quantitative PCR (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA), and two libraries were pooled to a total of 500 ng for exome enrichment using the Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit (Whole Exome_v1.1; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Several captures were pooled further and sequenced in one or more lanes to a final equivalent of two exomes per lane on a HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). :: PMID: 26457647			Controlled	PCR AMPLICON	Sample	SJJMML014770_D1.bam	10902242	bam	s3://cds-256-phs002504-sequencefiles-p30-fy20/SJJMML014770_D1.bam	Illumina MiSeq		SJJMML413D.Amplicon	Paired end	PCR	Not Reported	Genomic		AMPLICON	73c9b8fa2316cbc1d907b8ca9f8e08e8	17767517	118458	Illumina		GRCh37			SJJMML014770_D1.bam				sequencing_file

In brief, DNA was fragmented by sonication (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA) to 150 bp and further purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Fifty ng of size-selected DNA was then ligated to specific adaptors during library preparation (Illumina TruSeq, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Each library was made with sample-specific barcodes and quantified by quantitative PCR (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA), and two libraries were pooled to a total of 500 ng for exome enrichment using the Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit (Whole Exome_v1.1; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Several captures were pooled further and sequenced in one or more lanes to a final equivalent of two exomes per lane on a HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). :: PMID: 26457647			Controlled	PCR AMPLICON	Sample	SJJMML014824_D1.bam.bai	650832	bam_index	s3://cds-256-phs002504-sequencefiles-p30-fy20/SJJMML014824_D1.bam.bai	Illumina MiSeq		SJJMML0868D.Amplicon	Paired end	PCR	Not Reported	Genomic		AMPLICON	7c8fc81ef0ea6fb21be59c463af66821	102795269	685317	Illumina		GRCh37			SJJMML014824_D1.bam.bai				sequencing_file

Each library was made with sample-specific barcodes and quantified by quantitative PCR (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA), and two libraries were pooled to a total of 500 ng for exome enrichment using the Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit (Whole Exome_v1.1; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Several captures were pooled further and sequenced in one or more lanes to a final equivalent of two exomes per lane on a HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). :: PMID: 26457647			Controlled	PCR AMPLICON	Sample	SJJMML014815_R1.bam	81806549	bam	s3://cds-256-phs002504-sequencefiles-p30-fy20/SJJMML014815_R1.bam	Illumina MiSeq		SJJMML1993R.Amplicon	Paired end	PCR	Not Reported	Genomic		AMPLICON	c747e9c9096185b90cee808f38837947	148284488	988597	Illumina		GRCh37			SJJMML014815_R1.bam				sequencing_file

Libraries were assessed by Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). FASTQ reads were trimmed with fastp to remove amplicon primer sequences and adapters then aligned using BWA5,. Variants called with VarScan23. Total mean and median coverage per alteration site examined in BAM files was 39,500× and 38,000x respectively. Minimum depth of ≥ 100 reads and ≥ 10 alternate reads were required to call alterations.

Several captures were pooled further and sequenced in one or more lanes to a final equivalent of two exomes per lane on a HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). :: PMID: 26457647			Controlled	PCR AMPLICON	Sample	SJJMML014775_D1.bam	43204621	bam	s3://cds-256-phs002504-sequencefiles-p30-fy20/SJJMML014775_D1.bam	Illumina MiSeq		SJJMML212D.Amplicon	Paired end	PCR	Not Reported	Genomic		AMPLICON	1a448202263ed278ee867c919ff8804b	78892916	525965	Illumina		GRCh37			SJJMML014775_D1.bam				sequencing_file

Libraries were assessed by Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). FASTQ reads were trimmed with fastp to remove amplicon primer sequences and adapters then aligned using BWA5,. Variants called with VarScan23. Total mean and median coverage per alteration site examined in BAM files was 39,500× and 38,000x respectively. Minimum depth of ≥ 100 reads and ≥ 10 alternate reads were required to call alterations.

In brief, DNA was fragmented by sonication (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA) to 150 bp and further purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Fifty ng of size-selected DNA was then ligated to specific adaptors during library preparation (Illumina TruSeq, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Each library was made with sample-specific barcodes and quantified by quantitative PCR (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA), and two libraries were pooled to a total of 500 ng for exome enrichment using the Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit (Whole Exome_v1.1; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Several captures were pooled further and sequenced in one or more lanes to a final equivalent of two exomes per lane on a HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). :: PMID: 26457647			Controlled	PCR AMPLICON	Sample	SJJMML014774_D1.bam.bai	719672	bam_index	s3://cds-256-phs002504-sequencefiles-p30-fy20/SJJMML014774_D1.bam.bai	Illumina MiSeq		SJJMML1484D.Amplicon	Paired end	PCR	Not Reported	Genomic		AMPLICON	d55e45699bc9ba60b50fff89ae953f8b	70163472	467774	Illumina		GRCh37			SJJMML014774_D1.bam.bai				sequencing_file
