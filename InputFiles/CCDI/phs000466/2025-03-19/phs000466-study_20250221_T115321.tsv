study	phs000466	phs000466	TARGET: Kidney, Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney (CCSK)	TARGET_CCSK	To further explore some more aggressive subtypes in pediatric cancer already under study in OCG, CGCI is partnering with TARGET initiative to support extensive sequencing analysis of three hard to treat childhood cancers: refractory to treatment cases of acute myeloid leukemia and two rare kidney tumors; clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) and rhabdoid tumor. CCSK is a rare, aggressive kidney tumor that usually occurs in children younger than 3 years of age and little is known about the biology of this disease. There are 13 patient cases in the CCSK dataset, each with gene expression, methylation and comprehensive next-generation sequencing to include whole genome sequencing of tumor/normal pairs and mRNA-seq.
