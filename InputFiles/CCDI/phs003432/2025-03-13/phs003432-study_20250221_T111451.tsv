study	phs003432	phs003432	Identification and Targeting of Treatment Resistant Progenitor Populations in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic	TALLsc	Our goal with this study was to identify the mechanisms of treatment resistance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using single-cell genomics. We profiled 40 T-ALL cases from the Children's Oncology Group AALL0434 clinical trial using CITE-seq/snATAC-seq, capturing a breadth of immunophenotypes, including early T-cell precursor (ETP) and near-ETP/non-ETP subtypes. By integrating analyses of T-ALL cells with the normal T-cell developmental trajectory, the study identified a specific subgroup of leukemia cells resembling bone marrow progenitors (BMP-like cells). These BMP-like cells were associated with treatment failure and poor overall survival in T-ALL patients. Overall, this study reveals comprehensive multiomic signatures for rapidly assessing risk and tailoring targeted treatment for high-risk T-ALL patients.
