study	phs000469	phs000469	TARGET: Cancer Model Systems (MDLS): Cell Lines and Xenografts (including PPTP)	TARGET_MDLS	As part of the TARGET initiative, some disease projects characterized tumor cell lines or xenografts, with or without matched normal comparators, as well as some normal non-involved tissues. MDLS includes acute leukemia cell lines and xenografts with matched primary and/or relapsed tumor information, neuroblastoma cell line and xenografts with matched controls, kidney tumor cell lines, normal brain tissues and embryonic stem cell lines. Additionally, in partnership with TARGET, 131 cell lines and xenografts from the NCI's Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (now under the PIVOT program) received next generation sequencing of the whole exome.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/sstr/report/phs000469		Completed					CCDI released;dbGaP released;Validated		d7d2e44c-f6cf-536d-b67d-930f66923fc0
