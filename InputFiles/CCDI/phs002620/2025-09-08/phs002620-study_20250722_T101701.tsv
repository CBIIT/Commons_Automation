study	phs002620	phs002620	Feasibility and Clinical Utility of Whole Genome Profiling in Pediatric and Young Adult Cancers	CCDI_MSK_phs002620	Comprehensive Whole Genome Sequencing and Whole Transcriptome (RNASeq) analyses from 114 pediatric patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering. This dataset was used as a prospective clinical utility and feasibility study. By using our Isabl infrastructure for precision medicine, we developed a 2-week end-to-end pipeline to analyze cfDNA, WGS and WTS, which we refer to as cWGTS.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002620.v1.p1		Completed			Genomic		CCDI released;dbGaP released;DCF indexed;Validated		a8e620c9-7abf-5158-b70f-d1d36d3f0de7
