Samples were first homogenized in 1mL TRIzol Reagent (ThermoFisher catalog #15596018) followed by phase separation with 200 μL chloroform. RNA was extracted using miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qaigen catalog #217084) on the QIAcube Connect. After RiboGreen quantification and quality control by Agilent BioAnalyzer, 18ng-11μg of total RNA underwent ribosomal depletion and library preparation using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Kit (illumina catalog #RS-122-1202).
