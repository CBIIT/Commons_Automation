Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI): Free the Data: Open Sharing of Comprehensive Genomic Childhood Cancer Datasets (Kansas)	CCDI-KUMC	"This study provides paired tumor normal genomic sequencing data from approximately 200 children with cancer, including both solid tumors and leukemias, done by the Childrenâ€™s Mercy Research Institute (CMRI) and University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC).

These data include whole genome sequencing (generally, ~20x), whole exome sequencing (generally, ~300x), bulk RNA sequencing (generally, ~80 million reads), and single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing (>50,000 reads/cell). Additional phenotypic, pathologic, and genetic data, gathered clinically for these samples, are also provided.
