Childhood Cancer Data Initiative	CCDI	"NCI’s Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is building a community centered around childhood cancer care and research data. Through enhanced data sharing, we can improve our understanding of cancer biology to improve preventive measures, treatment, quality of life, and survivorship, as well as ensure that researchers learn from every child with cancer.

While childhood cancers represent the leading cause of death by disease in children over the age of 1, they are collectively rare, comprising about 1%‒3% of cancers diagnosed annually in the United States. Information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes is often stored at the hospital or institution where a child is treated, making it difficult to answer scientific questions about childhood cancer.

Sharing clinical care and research data generated by children’s hospitals, clinics, or networks broadly with the community can help us learn faster and on a scale much larger than any single institution caring for children can learn on its own."	https://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/childhood/childhood-cancer-data-initiative	National Cancer Institute	program
