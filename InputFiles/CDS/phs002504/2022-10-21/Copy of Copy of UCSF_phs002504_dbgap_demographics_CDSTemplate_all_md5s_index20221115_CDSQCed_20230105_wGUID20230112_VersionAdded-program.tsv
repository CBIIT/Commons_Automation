Childhood Cancer Data Initiative	CCDI	Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare and frequently fatal myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder of early childhood with an estimated incidence of 1.2 cases per million. It is associated with a spectrum of diverse outcomes ranging from spontaneous resolution in rare patients to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia in others. The overwhelming majority of JMML patients (~95%) will harbor mutations in canonical Ras pathway genes, including NF1, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, and CBL. As Ras proteins are mutated in more than 30% of human cancers, the information gleaned from the study of JMML has provided insights into Ras signaling in cancer as well as a group of congenital diseases with tumor predispositions known as the “Rasopathies”. While oncogenic Ras is one of the most common mutations in human cancer, it remains one of the most vexing targets for efficacious therapy.	https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/	University of California San Francisco	program
