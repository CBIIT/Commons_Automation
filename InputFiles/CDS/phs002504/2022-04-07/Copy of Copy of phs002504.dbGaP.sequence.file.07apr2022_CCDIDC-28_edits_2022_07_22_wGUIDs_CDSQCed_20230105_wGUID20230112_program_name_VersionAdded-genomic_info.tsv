Libraries were assessed by Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). FASTQ reads were trimmed with fastp to remove amplicon primer sequences and adapters then aligned using BWA5,. Variants called with VarScan23. Total mean and median coverage per alteration site examined in BAM files was 39,500× and 38,000x respectively. Minimum depth of ≥ 100 reads and ≥ 10 alternate reads were required to call alterations. Mean and median unique reads per mutation was 6,600x and 6,400x respectively.  :: PMID: 34183765	Amplicon	Paired-End	Genomic	PCR	Illumina	Illumina MiSeq		genomic_info	dg.4DFC/fca77e49-b41b-4ac3-a033-e5b61f77eaa4_6LUY912.Amplicon	dg.4DFC/fca77e49-b41b-4ac3-a033-e5b61f77eaa4

Libraries were assessed by Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). FASTQ reads were trimmed with fastp to remove amplicon primer sequences and adapters then aligned using BWA5,. Variants called with VarScan23. Total mean and median coverage per alteration site examined in BAM files was 39,500× and 38,000x respectively. Minimum depth of ≥ 100 reads and ≥ 10 alternate reads were required to call alterations.

Total mean and median coverage per alteration site examined in BAM files was 39,500× and 38,000x respectively. Minimum depth of ≥ 100 reads and ≥ 10 alternate reads were required to call alterations. Mean and median unique reads per mutation was 6,600x and 6,400x respectively.  :: PMID: 34183765	Bisulfite-Seq	Paired-End	Genomic	Hybrid Selection	Illumina	Illumina NovaSeq 6000		genomic_info	dg.4DFC/6de33113-1d9a-4c77-9b6b-6f652b8be602_6LU3854.Bisulfite-Seq	dg.4DFC/6de33113-1d9a-4c77-9b6b-6f652b8be602

HM5691.Bisulfite-Seq	150				Not specified in data	DNA samples (32 from the technical cohort and 47 from the independent validation cohort) were sequenced using a custom amplicon panel (Paragon Genomics, Hayward, CA, USA), targeting 26 genes that are recurrently mutated in JMML (Supplementary Methods Table 1). Ten nanograms of genomic DNA were used for each library and were processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Library quality was assessed using the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Analysis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and quantified using the Qubit HS assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Dual-index libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using the 150 bp PE mode. Mean on-target sequencing depth was 1519x (median = 1297x). :: PMID: 33139265	Bisulfite-Seq	Paired-End	Genomic	Hybrid Selection	Illumina	Illumina NovaSeq 6000		genomic_info	dg.4DFC/1e8aa192-1f94-47f6-b99b-692540f92381_HM5691.Bisulfite-Seq	dg.4DFC/1e8aa192-1f94-47f6-b99b-692540f92381
