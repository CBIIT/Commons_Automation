Through enhanced data sharing, we can improve our understanding of cancer biology to improve preventive measures, treatment, quality of life, and survivorship, as well as ensure that researchers learn from every child with cancer.

While childhood cancers represent the leading cause of death by disease in children over the age of 1, they are collectively rare, comprising about 1%‒3% of cancers diagnosed annually in the United States. Information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes is often stored at the hospital or institution where a child is treated, making it difficult to answer scientific questions about childhood cancer.

Sharing clinical care and research data generated by children’s hospitals, clinics, or networks broadly with the community can help us learn faster and on a scale much larger than any single institution caring for children can learn on its own."

program	DCCPS	79e396c4-6d34-45a1-8974-b90d1c7db3f8	"As NCI’s bridge to public health research, practice, and policy, the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) plays a unique role in reducing the burden of cancer in America. DCCPS, an extramural division, has the lead responsibility at NCI for supporting research in surveillance, epidemiology, health services, behavioral science, and cancer survivorship. The division also plays a central role within the federal government as a source of expertise and evidence on issues such as the quality of cancer care, the economic burden of cancer, geographic information systems, statistical methods, communication science, comparative effectiveness research, obesity and tobacco control, and the translation of research into practice. As a result, DCCPS is what many have referred to as a ""hybrid"" division—one that funds a large portfolio of grants and contracts, but also conducts original research to inform public health policy.

The diverse science funded and conducted by DCCPS is characterized by the varied and complex expertise and backgrounds of the division’s scientific staff. Given the focus on cancer control, it comes as no surprise that the disciplines of epidemiology and biostatistics are well represented. In addition, DCCPS has made a special effort to recruit experts in disciplines such as communication, anthropology, outcomes research, psychometrics, medical genetics, health psychology, economics, social work, policy analysis, geography, and family medicine—all disciplines that have been historically underrepresented at NCI. This reflects an overarching philosophy of science that guides the division’s planning and priority setting: the belief that scientific progress in the 21st century will depend on the transdisciplinary integration of research methods, models, and levels of analysis."

program	HTAN	d9b3fb23-3860-48ee-a26a-2f92a339569c	"The Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) is a National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Moonshot initiative focused on studying the transitions of human cancers as they evolve from precancerous lesions to advanced disease.

The network consists of ten research centers and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Five of the research centers are focused on developing pre-cancer atlases, and the remaining five centers are focused on developing tumor atlases. We also have two pilot projects, one focused on pre-cancer atlases, and one focused on tumor atlases.

Each research center is responsible for gathering and processing samples, and running their own experimental assays. Assays vary by center, but most centers have a strong focus on single cell RNA-Seq and a wide range of multiplex imaging modalities.

All centers are required to submit their clinical, biospecimen and assay data to the HTAN DCC using a common HTAN Data Model. The DCC makes HTAN data available to the wider scientific community."	HTAN Consortium	Human Tumor Atlas Network	https://humantumoratlas.org/
