HINTS-SEER	Population Science	C211500	"HINTS-SEER is a cross-sectional survey that sampled cancer survivors from three different SEER cancer registries. Sampling frames of survivors from each registry were stratified by time since diagnosis and race/ethnicity, with non-malignant tumors and non-melanoma skin cancers excluded. Respondents who consented completed a self-administered questionnaire sent through the mail and resulted in a total sample of 1,234 respondents. The goal of HINTS-SEER was to better understand the communication needs and practices, information preferences, risk behaviors and cancer knowledge of cancer survivors using a modified version of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) specifically designed for cancers survivors."	hints.cancer.gov	Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS-SEER)	phs004065.v1.p1
