Survey researchers are using the data to understand how adults 18 years and older use different communication channels, including the Internet, to obtain vital health information for themselves and their loved ones. Program planners are using the data to overcome barriers to health information usage across populations, and obtaining the data they need to create more effective communication strategies. Finally, social scientists are using the data to refine their theories of health communication in the information age and to offer new and better recommendations for reducing the burden of cancer throughout the population. HINTS data are available for public use.	DCCPS	The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) regularly collects nationally representative data about the American publics knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information.
