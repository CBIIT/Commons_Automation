program	MP2PRT			0873c0e6-d4eb-4069-8735-0a2c779d233b	The MP2PRT program is a Cancer Moonshot Research Initiative focused on the retrospective analysis of biospecimens already collected from patients enrolled on completed NCI-sponsored clinical trials of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) that have outcome results available.  The generation of comprehensive molecular characterization data that can be paired with standardized treatment and outcome data will help accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms that drive individual tumor types and identify signatures to predict responses to treatment.  These analyses will also help refine patient subclassification at the molecular level and identify patient subgroups that may not need therapeutic intervention at all - e.g., patients whose tumors are not aggressive and who may be currently 'over-diagnosed' and thus receive treatment without significant benefit. A comparison of tumor characteristics associated with clinical benefit with tumor characteristics associated with resistance to therapy will also set the framework to help inform ongoing and future clinical trials being carried out in pursuit of more effective treatments.
