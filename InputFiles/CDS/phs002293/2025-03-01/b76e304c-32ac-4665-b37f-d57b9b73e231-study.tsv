The NCI-sponsored NRG Oncology/GOG-0240 was selected for inclusion into this Cancer Moonshot program.  GOG-0240 is a phase 3, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, multi-national trial studying the efficacy and toxicology of chemotherapy doublets with and without bevacizumab for primary treatment of women with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer (NCT00803062).  Squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous histology were eligible and all cases underwent central pathology review.  The trial met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response.  Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples and matched normal peripheral blood were collected and shipped to the NRG Oncology Biospecimen Bank in Columbus, Ohio.  Following acceptance into the MP2PRT program, biospecimens underwent pathology QAQC and DNA and RNA extraction, and 182 of the 412 cases that submitted biospecimen material were determined to have passing tumor and necrosis metrics and sufficient analyte for next generation sequencing. Whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing were performed by the New York Genome Center.  Total RNA sequencing and micro RNA sequencing were performed by the High Throughput Sequencing Facility at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine."
