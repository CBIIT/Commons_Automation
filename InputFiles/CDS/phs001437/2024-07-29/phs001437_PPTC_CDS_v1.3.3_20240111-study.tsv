Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) PDX Data Models	PPTC	"The Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) is addressing the unmet need of streamlining the development of new therapies for childhood cancers. The PPTC seeks to develop robust biomarkers of anticancer drug activity, and the majority of these are predicted to be genetic mutations that can be detected in tumor DNA and/or RNA. In order to design the most impactful experiments that can be rapidly translated to the clinic, PPTC investigators require a complete genomic characterization of the patient-derived xenograft tumor models that are utilized across the consortium. This will not only allow for the most robust experimental design, but also will increase the engagement of industry partners who seek collaborators poised to provide the proof-of-concept necessary for drugs in their development pipelines. All data and models will be made available to academically qualified investigators.
