TCGA WGS Variants Across 18 Cancer Types	Even though whole genome sequence (WGS) data has been generated and published in many studies, much of this information is not yet processed for use in down-stream analysis. This study's aim is to provide 1342 WGS normal-tumor paired single nucleotide variations (SNP) over 18 different cancer types provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Individual level data for TCGA can be accessed by requesting access for phs000178. This data includes variations within self-reported white and African-American populations. Variations that exist within the tumor tissue but are absent in associated normal organ tissue (as compared to the human reference genome) are reported. Data published includes SNP and small insertions and deletions, which were generated through a pipeline including the VarScan2 variant calling software.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003155.v1.p1	John Torcivia, Ph.D	torcivia@gwmail.gwu.edu	phs003155	1342	2684	Genomic	['phs003155']	Controlled	['programs/phs003155']	phs003155.v1.p1	study	TCGA	Not specified in data
