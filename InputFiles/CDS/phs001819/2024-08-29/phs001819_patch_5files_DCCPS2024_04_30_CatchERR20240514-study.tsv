Whole Genome Sequencing to Discover Familial Myeloma Risk Genes	We identified germline truncating mutations in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumors. KDM1A mutation burden is higher in sporadic MM patients than in controls, and mRNA levels are lower in MM compared with normal plasma cells. KDM1A pharmacological inhibition in vitro promotes myeloma cell proliferation, and in mice promotes plasma cell expansion, enhanced secondary immune response to T cell dependent antigens, and upregulation of MYC oncogene transcriptional targets. Our findings provide important new insights into the role of KDM1A to suppress B cell malignancies., We identified germlineÊKDM1AÊtruncating mutations in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumors.
