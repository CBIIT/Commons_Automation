CCDI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program - Leukemia	CCDI PIVOT LEU	"The goal of this study is to molecularly characterize a large panel of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) previously established in immune-deficient mice. These PDXs are utilized as part of the NCI-funded Pediatric Preclinical In vivo Testing (PIVOT) program to identify novel agents and combinations. Biospecimen data include next-generation sequencing (RNAseq, whole exome sequencing, DNA copy number variation), whole-genome analysis of cytogenetic abnormalities, and DNA fingerprint for quality control.
