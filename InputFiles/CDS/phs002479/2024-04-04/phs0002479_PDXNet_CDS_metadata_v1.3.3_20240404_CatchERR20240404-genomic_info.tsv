Briefly, genomic DNA (approximately 200 ng to 3 ug) is sheared in a 130 ul volume using a Covaris S2 Focused-ultrasonicator with the following settings: Intensity 5.0; Duty Cycle 10%25; Cycles per Burst 200; Treatment Time 6:00 minutes.  Sheared DNA is converted to blunt-ended fragments with 5'-phosphates and 3'-hydroxyl groups using a combination of enzymes that perform fill-in reactions and exhibit exonuclease activity.  An A-base is added to the blunt-ended DNA as a means to prepare the fragments for adapter ligation and to block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (6 cycles) and the amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads.  The concentration of the amplified library is measured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362)assay to define the size range. Amplified libraries (750 ng) are hybridized with biotinilyated RNA baits from the Agilent Technologies SureSelect(XT) Human All Exon v5 plus UTRs kit  (5190-6213).  Library molecules hybridized to the SureSelect baits are purified using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (Life Technologies cat# 65601).  Index tags are added to the adapters of the captured library by pcr (10 cycles) using Agilent Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase (600677) and primers from the Agilent Technologies SureSelect XT Reagent Kit and the amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads.  The concentration of the amplified, exome-enriched library is  measured using the Invitrogen Qubit dsDNA HS Assay (Q32851) and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362) or a High Sensitivity D1K (cat# 5067-5363 and 5067-5364) assay to define the size distribution of the sequencing library.  Libraries are adjusted to a concentration of approximately 5 nM and quantitative PCR is performed using the KapaBiosystems Kapa Library Quant Kit (cat# KK4824) to calculate the molarity of adapter ligated library molecules.  The concentration is further adjusted following qPCR to prepare the library for Illumina sequence analysis.

Briefly, genomic DNA (approximately 200 ng to 3 ug) is sheared in a 130 ul volume using a Covaris S2 Focused-ultrasonicator with the following settings: Intensity 5.0; Duty Cycle 10%25; Cycles per Burst 200; Treatment Time 6:00 minutes.  Sheared DNA is converted to blunt-ended fragments with 5'-phosphates and 3'-hydroxyl groups using a combination of enzymes that perform fill-in reactions and exhibit exonuclease activity.  An A-base is added to the blunt-ended DNA as a means to prepare the fragments for adapter ligation and to block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (6 cycles) and the amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads.  The concentration of the amplified library is measured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362)assay to define the size range. Amplified libraries (750 ng) are hybridized with biotinilyated RNA baits from the Agilent Technologies SureSelect(XT) Human All Exon v5 plus UTRs kit  (5190-6213).  Library molecules hybridized to the SureSelect baits are purified using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (Life Technologies cat# 65601).  Index tags are added to the adapters of the captured library by pcr (10 cycles) using Agilent Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase (600677) and primers from the Agilent Technologies SureSelect XT Reagent Kit and the amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads.  The concentration of the amplified, exome-enriched library is  measured using the Invitrogen Qubit dsDNA HS Assay (Q32851) and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362) or a High Sensitivity D1K (cat# 5067-5363 and 5067-5364) assay to define the size distribution of the sequencing library.

Briefly, genomic DNA (approximately 200 ng to 3 ug) is sheared in a 130 ul volume using a Covaris S2 Focused-ultrasonicator with the following settings: Intensity 5.0; Duty Cycle 10%25; Cycles per Burst 200; Treatment Time 6:00 minutes.  Sheared DNA is converted to blunt-ended fragments with 5'-phosphates and 3'-hydroxyl groups using a combination of enzymes that perform fill-in reactions and exhibit exonuclease activity.  An A-base is added to the blunt-ended DNA as a means to prepare the fragments for adapter ligation and to block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (6 cycles) and the amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads.

Briefly, genomic DNA (approximately 200 ng to 3 ug) is sheared in a 130 ul volume using a Covaris S2 Focused-ultrasonicator with the following settings: Intensity 5.0; Duty Cycle 10%25; Cycles per Burst 200; Treatment Time 6:00 minutes.  Sheared DNA is converted to blunt-ended fragments with 5'-phosphates and 3'-hydroxyl groups using a combination of enzymes that perform fill-in reactions and exhibit exonuclease activity.  An A-base is added to the blunt-ended DNA as a means to prepare the fragments for adapter ligation and to block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (6 cycles) and the amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads.  The concentration of the amplified library is measured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362)assay to define the size range.

Additional details of the library preparation process are described below: Library construction is performed using the Illumina TruSeq  RNA Library Preparation Kit v2 (RS-122-2001 and RS-122-2002) as described below,  Briefly, total RNA (100 ng to 500 ng) is poly-A selected using poly-T  oligo-attached magnetic beads.  Poly-A RNA is eluted from the magnetic beads is fragmented and primed with random hexamers in preparation for cDNA synthesis.  First strand reverse transcription is accomplished using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen cat#18064-014).  Following second strand synthesis, the cDNA is converted to blunt-ended fragments with 5'-phosphates and 3'-hydroxyl groups using a combination of enzymes that perform fill-in reactions and exhibit exonuclease activity.  An A-base is added to the blunt ends as a means to prepare the fragments for adapter ligation and block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang  are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (12 cycles) and the amplified library is purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics cat#A63881).  The concentration of the amplified library is measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362) or a High Sensitivity D1K (cat# 5067-5363 and 5067-5364) assay to define the size distribution of the sequencing library.  Libraries are adjusted to a concentration of approximately 10 nM and quantitative PCR is performed using the KapaBiosystems Kapa Library Quant Kit (cat# KK4824) to calculate the molarity of adapter ligated library molecules.  The concentration is further adjusted following qPCR to prepare the library for Illumina sequence analysis.

Briefly, Ribosomal RNA is removed from total RNA samples (100 ng to 4 ug) using biotinylated Ribo-Zero oligos attached to magnetic beads that are complimentary to cytoplasmic rRNA. Following purification, the rRNA-depleted sample is fragmented with divalent cations under elevated temperatures and primed with random hexamers in preparation for cDNA synthesis.  First strand reverse transcription is accomplished using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen cat#18064-014).  Second strand cDNA synthesis is accomplished using DNA polymerase I and Rnase H under conditions in which dUTP is substituted for dTTP, yielding blunt-ended cDNA fragments in which the second strand with dUTP.  An A-base is added to the blunt ends as a means to prepare the cDNA fragments for adapter ligation and block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang  are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (12-15 cycles) under conditions in which the pcr reaction enables amplification of the first strand cDNA product, whereas attempted amplifciation of the second strand product stalls at dUTP bases and therefore is not represented in the amplified library.  The PCR-amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics cat#A63881).  Follwoing amplification, the library is purified by bead based methodologies.  The concentration of the amplified library is measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362) or a High Sensitivity D1K (cat# 5067-5363 and 5067-5364) assay to define the size distribution of the sequencing library.

Briefly, Ribosomal RNA is removed from total RNA samples (100 ng to 4 ug) using biotinylated Ribo-Zero oligos attached to magnetic beads that are complimentary to cytoplasmic rRNA. Following purification, the rRNA-depleted sample is fragmented with divalent cations under elevated temperatures and primed with random hexamers in preparation for cDNA synthesis.  First strand reverse transcription is accomplished using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen cat#18064-014).  Second strand cDNA synthesis is accomplished using DNA polymerase I and Rnase H under conditions in which dUTP is substituted for dTTP, yielding blunt-ended cDNA fragments in which the second strand with dUTP.  An A-base is added to the blunt ends as a means to prepare the cDNA fragments for adapter ligation and block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang  are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (12-15 cycles) under conditions in which the pcr reaction enables amplification of the first strand cDNA product, whereas attempted amplifciation of the second strand product stalls at dUTP bases and therefore is not represented in the amplified library.

Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (12-15 cycles) under conditions in which the pcr reaction enables amplification of the first strand cDNA product, whereas attempted amplifciation of the second strand product stalls at dUTP bases and therefore is not represented in the amplified library.  The PCR-amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics cat#A63881).  Follwoing amplification, the library is purified by bead based methodologies.  The concentration of the amplified library is measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362) or a High Sensitivity D1K (cat# 5067-5363 and 5067-5364) assay to define the size distribution of the sequencing library.  Libraries are adjusted to a concentration of approximately 10 nM and quantitative PCR is performed using the KapaBiosystems Kapa Library Quant Kit (cat# KK4824) to calculate the molarity of adapter ligated library molecules.

Second strand cDNA synthesis is accomplished using DNA polymerase I and Rnase H under conditions in which dUTP is substituted for dTTP, yielding blunt-ended cDNA fragments in which the second strand with dUTP.  An A-base is added to the blunt ends as a means to prepare the cDNA fragments for adapter ligation and block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang  are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (12-15 cycles) under conditions in which the pcr reaction enables amplification of the first strand cDNA product, whereas attempted amplifciation of the second strand product stalls at dUTP bases and therefore is not represented in the amplified library.  The PCR-amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics cat#A63881).  Follwoing amplification, the library is purified by bead based methodologies.  The concentration of the amplified library is measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362) or a High Sensitivity D1K (cat# 5067-5363 and 5067-5364) assay to define the size distribution of the sequencing library.  Libraries are adjusted to a concentration of approximately 10 nM and quantitative PCR is performed using the KapaBiosystems Kapa Library Quant Kit (cat# KK4824) to calculate the molarity of adapter ligated library molecules.

An A-base is added to the blunt ends as a means to prepare the cDNA fragments for adapter ligation and block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang  are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (12-15 cycles) under conditions in which the pcr reaction enables amplification of the first strand cDNA product, whereas attempted amplifciation of the second strand product stalls at dUTP bases and therefore is not represented in the amplified library.  The PCR-amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics cat#A63881).  Follwoing amplification, the library is purified by bead based methodologies.

Stranded RNA sequencing libraries were prepared as described using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold (RS-122-2301 and RS-122-2302).  Purified libraries were qualified on an Agilent Technologies 2200 TapeStation using a D1000 ScreenTape assay (cat# 5067-5582 and 5067-5583).  The molarity of adapter-modified molecules was defined by quantitative PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Kapa Library Quant Kit (cat#KK4824).  Individual libraries were normalized to 10 nM and equal volumes were pooled in preparation for Illumina sequence analysis. Additional details of the library preparation process are described below: Library construction is performed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation Kit with Ribo-Zero Human/Mouse/Rat (cat# RS-122-2201, RS-122-2202) as described below.  Briefly, Ribosomal RNA is removed from total RNA samples (100 ng to 4 ug) using biotinylated Ribo-Zero oligos attached to magnetic beads that are complimentary to cytoplasmic rRNA. Following purification, the rRNA-depleted sample is fragmented with divalent cations under elevated temperatures and primed with random hexamers in preparation for cDNA synthesis.  First strand reverse transcription is accomplished using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen cat#18064-014).  Second strand cDNA synthesis is accomplished using DNA polymerase I and Rnase H under conditions in which dUTP is substituted for dTTP, yielding blunt-ended cDNA fragments in which the second strand with dUTP.  An A-base is added to the blunt ends as a means to prepare the cDNA fragments for adapter ligation and block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang  are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (12-15 cycles) under conditions in which the pcr reaction enables amplification of the first strand cDNA product, whereas attempted amplifciation of the second strand product stalls at dUTP bases and therefore is not represented in the amplified library.  The PCR-amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics cat#A63881).  Follwoing amplification, the library is purified by bead based methodologies.  The concentration of the amplified library is measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362) or a High Sensitivity D1K (cat# 5067-5363 and 5067-5364) assay to define the size distribution of the sequencing library.

Stranded RNA sequencing libraries were prepared as described using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold (RS-122-2301 and RS-122-2302).  Purified libraries were qualified on an Agilent Technologies 2200 TapeStation using a D1000 ScreenTape assay (cat# 5067-5582 and 5067-5583).  The molarity of adapter-modified molecules was defined by quantitative PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Kapa Library Quant Kit (cat#KK4824).  Individual libraries were normalized to 10 nM and equal volumes were pooled in preparation for Illumina sequence analysis. Additional details of the library preparation process are described below: Library construction is performed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation Kit with Ribo-Zero Human/Mouse/Rat (cat# RS-122-2201, RS-122-2202) as described below.  Briefly, Ribosomal RNA is removed from total RNA samples (100 ng to 4 ug) using biotinylated Ribo-Zero oligos attached to magnetic beads that are complimentary to cytoplasmic rRNA. Following purification, the rRNA-depleted sample is fragmented with divalent cations under elevated temperatures and primed with random hexamers in preparation for cDNA synthesis.  First strand reverse transcription is accomplished using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen cat#18064-014).  Second strand cDNA synthesis is accomplished using DNA polymerase I and Rnase H under conditions in which dUTP is substituted for dTTP, yielding blunt-ended cDNA fragments in which the second strand with dUTP.  An A-base is added to the blunt ends as a means to prepare the cDNA fragments for adapter ligation and block concatamer formation during the ligation step.  Adapters containing a T-base overhang  are ligated to the A-tailed DNA fragments.  Ligated fragments are PCR-amplified (12-15 cycles) under conditions in which the pcr reaction enables amplification of the first strand cDNA product, whereas attempted amplifciation of the second strand product stalls at dUTP bases and therefore is not represented in the amplified library.  The PCR-amplified library is purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics cat#A63881).  Follwoing amplification, the library is purified by bead based methodologies.  The concentration of the amplified library is measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an aliquot of the library is resolved on an Agilent 2200 Tape Station using a D1K (cat# 5067-5361 and 5067-5362) or a High Sensitivity D1K (cat# 5067-5363 and 5067-5364) assay to define the size distribution of the sequencing library.  Libraries are adjusted to a concentration of approximately 10 nM and quantitative PCR is performed using the KapaBiosystems Kapa Library Quant Kit (cat# KK4824) to calculate the molarity of adapter ligated library molecules.  The concentration is further adjusted following qPCR to prepare the library for Illumina sequence analysis.
