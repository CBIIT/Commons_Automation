HCI-PDX Trial Center for Breast Cancer Therapy	HCI-PDX	"The HCI-PDX Trial Center for Breast Cancer Therapy study is a collection of patient-tumor samples that are serially established as patient-derived tumor xenografts (human tumor in mouse) and matching organoids. For this study, we describe valuable methods and resources to generate organoids and use them as cost-effective models for precision drug screens. This study leveraged whole-exome sequencing, RNAseq, and SNP-array data to illustrate how the heterogeneity of tumors is preserved in xenograft and organoid models. Sequencing files are provided for whole-exome and RNAseq data. Processed copy number variant calls from the SNP arrays are also available. A full description of the study can be found in the article entitled, ""A human breast cancer-derived xenograft and organoid platform for drug discovery and precision oncology,"" written by Guillen et al., 2022 in Nature Cancer (PMID: 35221336). Study Design: Xenograft; Study Type: Case Set, Exome Sequencing, Genotype, RNA Sequencing; Total number of consented subjects: 37"	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002479.v1.p1	phs002479	NCI; Breast Cancer Research Foundation; Department of Defense	NCI;Breast Cancer Research Foundation Founders Fund;DOD Breast Cancer Research Program	U54CA224076;U01CA217617; DOD Breakthrough Award W81XWH1410417;DOD Era of Hope Scholar Award W81XWH1210077	Human	37	152	Genomic	['phs002479']	Controlled	['programs/phs002479']	phs002479.v1.p1	Principal Investigator	Dr.	Matthew	Bailey	mbailey@genome.wustl.edu	study	PDXNet	Not specified in data
