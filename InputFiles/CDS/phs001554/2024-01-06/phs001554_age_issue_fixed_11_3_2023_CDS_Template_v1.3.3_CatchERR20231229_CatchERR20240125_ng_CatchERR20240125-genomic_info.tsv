Lib117828: 117828	79493181702	975512459	81	25.1	GRCh37	Initial QC on samples for DNA concentration and gender validation were completed at UW. Passing samples were sent to Macrogen for library production and sequencing. In order to sequence refined DNA as short read, fragmentation was performed as follows: minimum of 0.4ugÊgDNA samples were prepared in Covaris 96 microTUBE plate and sheared through aÊCovaris LE220 focused ultrasonicator targeting 350 bp inserts. The resulting sheared DNA was selectively purified by using sample purification beads to make the precise length of insert; End-repair (repaired to blunt end), A-tailing (A-base is added to 3Õend), and ligation (Y-shaped adapter is used) were performed as directed by TruSeq PCR free Kit (Illumina, cat# FC-121-3003)Êprotocols.ÊA second Bead cleanup was performed after ligation to remove any residual reagents and adapter dimers.
