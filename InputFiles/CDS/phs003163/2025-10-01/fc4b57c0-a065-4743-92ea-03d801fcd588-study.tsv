To design impactful experiments that can be rapidly translated to the clinic, PIVOT investigators require comprehensive genomic characterization of the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models used across the consortium. This robust experimental design enhances collaboration with industry partners by providing proof-of-concept data for drugs in development.As part of this effort, neuroblastoma PDX models are being molecularly characterized to identify promising therapeutic candidates. The molecular profiling includes whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA-seq, MethylEPIC array, CytoSNP array, and DNA fingerprinting for quality control. Additionally, demographic and clinical data (e.g., diagnosis, disease site, disease status) are shared. These characterized PDX models, matched with patient tumors, guide model selection for preclinical drug testing.Study Weblinks: Pediatric Preclinical In Vivo Testing Consortium (PIVOT) https://https://preclinicalpivot.org/about-pivot Study Design: Xenograft Study Type: Exome Sequencing Genotype Methylation Sequencing Repository RNA Sequencing Xenograft Total number of consented subjects: 36		Controlled	CCDI_PIVOT_NBL_phs003163	Sequence Data|Copy Number Variation|Methylation Analysis	C153329|C181330|C190764	The goal of NCI's Pediatric In Vivo Testing Consortium (PIVOT) is to advance the development of effective treatments for pediatric cancers through preclinical in vivo testing of novel therapeutic agents.
