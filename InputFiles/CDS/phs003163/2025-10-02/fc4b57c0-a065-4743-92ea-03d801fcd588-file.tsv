Raw reads were first trimmed for quality using a custom python script. Human / mouse disambiguation of quality filtered reads was done with Xenome. Human specifc reads were mapped with BWA to GRCh38. Duplicate reads were marked with Picard MarkDuplicates. Base recalibration was then done and applied with GATK. Variants were called with GATK Mutect2 in tumor only mode, reads were called against a panel of normal samples from the 1000 genome project and germline reference from the GnomAD project both references provided by GATK. Variants were soft filtered with FilterMutectCalls, and depth and quality filters. Variant were annotated with dbsnpID"	Sample	C70699	6949-JMM-0065_INDEL_filtered_dbsnpID.vcf	1903647	VCF	C172216	s3://cds-515-phs003163-pivot-chop/chphiladelphia/jax_lab_files/wes/6949-JMM-0065/6949-JMM-0065_INDEL_filtered_dbsnpID.vcf		25b66858217722b3b824d280d430d50a	2025-10-03T12:02:01Z	6949-JMM-0065.pdx.samp	phs003163	phs003163.v1.p1

Duplicate reads were marked with Picard MarkDuplicates. Base recalibration was then done and applied with GATK. Variants were called with GATK Mutect2 in tumor only mode, reads were called against a panel of normal samples from the 1000 genome project and germline reference from the GnomAD project both references provided by GATK.

Duplicate reads were marked with Picard MarkDuplicates. Base recalibration was then done and applied with GATK.

Duplicate reads were marked with Picard MarkDuplicates. Base recalibration was then done and applied with GATK. Variants were called with GATK Mutect2 in tumor only mode, reads were called against a panel of normal samples from the 1000 genome project and germline reference from the GnomAD project both references provided by GATK.

Containins the allele-specific copy-number of all assayed loci (copy-number on the Y-axis vs. the genomic location on the X-axis; for illustrative purposes only, both lines are slightly shifted such that they do not overlap; only probes heterozygous in the germline are shown). These ASCAT profiles allow accurate derivation of gains (which can be further subdivided into, e.g., duplications, triplications, and amplifications), losses (of one or more copies), copy-number-neutral events, and LOH."
