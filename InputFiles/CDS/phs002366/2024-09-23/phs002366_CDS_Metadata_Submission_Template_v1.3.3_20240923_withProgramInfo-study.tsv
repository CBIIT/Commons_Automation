Lung Cancer Genetic Study among Asian Never Smokers	The Lung Cancer Genetic Study Among Asian Never Smokers includes data from four population-based studies conducted among Asian women: the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), the Hwasun Cancer Epidemiology Study (HCES1 and HCES2), the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia (FLCCA, including sFLCA), and the Guangzhou Lung Cancer Study (GLCS). Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS): The SWHS is a population-based prospective cohort study of approximately 75,000 adult women who were recruited between 1997 and 2000. The cohort has been followed by a combination of record linkage and active follow-ups. Lung cancer patients identified in the SWHS and non-cases were included in the current study. Hwasun Cancer Epidemiology Study-Lung Cancer (HCES1 and HCES2): The HCES is a hospital-based case-control study whose goal is to identify factors of the cancer development and clinical progression in a Korean population. Included in this project were 299 female lung cancer cases from HCES2, who were diagnosed between April 2004 and February 2013 at Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, a cancer specified hospital in Jeollanam-do province, South Korea. Controls were randomly selected from women with no previous cancer diagnosis at enrollment in the Namwon Study and the Dong-gu study, ongoing community-based cohort studies in South Korea. A total of 1,103 controls (273 from HCES1 and 830 from HCES2) were genotyped by MEGA.Guangzhou Lung Cancer Study (GLCS): The GLCS is a case-control study including never-smoking women lung cancer cases and controls from Guangzhou, China. In this study, the DNA samples of 1,195 subjects from SWHS and GLCS were genotyped using whole exome sequencing (WES), and the DNA samples of 7,174 subjects from SWHS, HCES1, HCES2, FLCCA, and sFLCA were genotyped using the Multi-Ethnic Global Array (MEGA). Study Design: Case-Control; Study Type: Case-Control, Cohort; dbGaP estimated ancestry using GRAF-pop; Total number of consented subjects: 8310	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002366.v2.p2	phs002366	1195	1195	Genomic	['phs002366.v2.p2']	Controlled	['/programs/phs002366.v2.p2']	phs002366.v2.p2	Vanderbilt University Medical Center	Associate  Professor	Xingyi	Guo	xingyi.guo@vumc.org	study	DCCPS	Not specified in data
