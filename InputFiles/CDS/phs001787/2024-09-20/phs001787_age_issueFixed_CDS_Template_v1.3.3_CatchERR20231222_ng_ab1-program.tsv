Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences	DCCPS	"As NCIs bridge to public health research, practice, and policy, the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) plays a unique role in reducing the burden of cancer in America. DCCPS, an extramural division, has the lead responsibility at NCI for supporting research in surveillance, epidemiology, health services, behavioral science, and cancer survivorship. The division also plays a central role within the federal government as a source of expertise and evidence on issues such as the quality of cancer care, the economic burden of cancer, geographic information systems, statistical methods, communication science, comparative effectiveness research, obesity and tobacco control, and the translation of research into practice. As a result, DCCPS is what many have referred to as a ""hybrid"" division≈Éone that funds a large portfolio of grants and contracts, but also conducts original research to inform public health policy."	https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/	National Cancer Institute	program
