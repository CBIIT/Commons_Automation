PDX (PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFTS) DEVELOPMENT AND TRIAL CENTERS RESEARCH NETWORK (PDXNET)	PDXNet	"The National Cancer Institute (NCI) launched the PDX (patient-derived xenografts) Development and Trial Centers Research Network (PDXNet) in September 2017 to accelerate translational research using PDX datasets.
The PDXNet comprises six PDX Development and Trial Centers (PDTCs) and the PDX Data Commons and Coordinating Center (PDCCC). The two PDTCs added in 2018 focus exclusively on developing minority PDXs. Collectively, the PDTCs and the PDCCC work together to test and advance multi-agent cancer treatments from PDX studies to human clinical trials."	https://www.pdxnetwork.org	National Cancer Institute	program
