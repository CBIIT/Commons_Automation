Wistar PDX Development and Trial Center SPORE in Skin Cancer	"Overall the outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an improved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens have been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas. These treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof-of-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will progress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been shown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments that prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are effective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies, over the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical, histological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of PDX models represents one of the largest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately recapitulates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also includes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been maintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a robust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we propose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued expansion of our robust melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical gaps in this disease.
