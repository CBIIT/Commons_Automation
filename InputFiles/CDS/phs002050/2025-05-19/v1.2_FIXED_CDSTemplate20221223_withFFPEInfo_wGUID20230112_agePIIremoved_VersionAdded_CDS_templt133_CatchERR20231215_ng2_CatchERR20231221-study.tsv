GECCO OICR: Molecular Pathological Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer	GECCO OICR	Colorectal cancer, the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, is a biologically heterogeneous disease. To characterize the molecular attributes of colorectal tumors, we conducted targeted sequencing at the Ontario Cancer Research Institution (OICR) of tumor and matched normal DNA samples from 2,542 colorectal cancer cases in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). These consortia are based on cohort and population-based case-control studies.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002050.v2.p1	phs002050	NCI, NIH	U01CA137088	2510	5056	Genomic	['phs002050']	Controlled	phs002050.v2.p1|hs002050.v2.p1	PI	Dr	Ulrike	Peters	UPETERS@fredhutch.ORG	study	DCCPS	Not specified in data
