0DIMVT					GRCh37	Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP(TM)) chemistry is purpose-built to accurately identify both simple and complex genetic mutations by leveraging the power of bidirectional primers and molecular barcodes, or MBCs, from low nucleic acid input in tissue or blood. AMP chemistry is also flexible, so it can be used for applications in DNA, RNA, and ctDNA sequencing across most tumor type.
