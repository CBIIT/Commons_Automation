CIDR: The Role of Rare Coding Variation in Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry - RESPOND Project 2	"""In RESPOND Project 2, we seek to identify rare genetic factors that are associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk and aggressiveness in men of African ancestry (AA). We will conduct exome sequencing of 15,000 prostate cancer cases and 5,000 controls from the RESPOND cohort and the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer Consortium (AAPC) with cases selected based on risk categories: high-risk (stage T3/T4 or Gleason 8+ or PSA>20 ng/ml), intermediate-risk (stage T2b/T2c or Gleason 7 or PSA 10-20 ng/ml) and low-risk disease (stage T1/T2a and Gleason ≤ 6 and PSA<10 ng/ml). We expect the findings from this Project to significantly advance knowledge of susceptibility to aggressive PCa and racial/ethnic disparities in PCa risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection and prognostic measures for AA men. The first phase of the study will include exome sequence data for approximately 7,500 cases and 5,000 controls from AAPC. The second phase of the study will include exome data for 5,000 cases from RESPOND and AAPC.

Southern Community Cohort (SCCS) is funded by NIH grant CA092447. SCCS sample preparation was conducted at the Epidemiology Biospecimen Core Lab that is supported in part by the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (CA68485). Data on SCCS cancer cases were provided by Alabama Statewide Cancer Registry, Kentucky Cancer Registry, Office of Cancer Surveillance at Tennessee Department of Health, Florida Cancer Data System, Central Cancer Registry at North Carolina Division of Public Health, Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Registry, Louisiana Tumor Registry, Mississippi Cancer Registry, South Carolina Central Cancer Registry, Virginia Cancer Registry at Virginia Department of Health, and Cancer Registry at Arkansas Department of Health. The Arkansas Central Cancer Registry is fully funded by a grant from National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Data on SCCS cancer cases from Mississippi were collected by the Mississippi Cancer Registry which participates in the NPCR/CDC.
