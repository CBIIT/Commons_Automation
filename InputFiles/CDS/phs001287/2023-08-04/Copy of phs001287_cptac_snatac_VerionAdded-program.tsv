CPTAC: Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium	CPTAC	"CPTAC is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of robust, quantitative, proteomic technologies and workflows. The overarching goal of CPTAC is to improve our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent cancer. To achieve this goal in a scientifically rigorous manner, the NCI launched CPTAC to systematically identify proteins that derive from alterations in cancer genomes and related biological processes, and provide this data with accompanying assays and protocols to the public.

CPTAC has provided the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) with genomic data from a total of 1500+ cancer patients with diverse disease types including Endometrial, Renal, Lung Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Breast, Colon, Ovarian, Brain, Head and Neck, and Pancreatic cancers. The GDC harmonized DNA sequences from CPTAC whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exomes sequencing (WXS), and RNA sequences with the GRCh38 reference genome using GDC DNA-Seq Analysis Pipelines and mRNA Analysis Pipelines, respectively. The CPTAC harmonized genomic data is available in the GDC Data Portal. CPTAC makes proteomic data that are processed through the CPTAC Common Data analysis Pipeline (CDAP) available in the CPTAC Data Portal. CPTAC proteomic data is also available in the Proteomic Data Commons (PDC)."	https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/contributed-genomic-data-cancer-research/clinical-proteomic-tumor-analysis-consortium-cptac#:~:text=The%20National%20Cancer%20Institute's%20Clinical,and%20genome%20analysis%2C%20or%20proteogenomics.
