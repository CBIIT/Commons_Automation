CPTAC: Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium	CPTAC	CPTAC is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of robust, quantitative, proteomic technologies and workflows. The overarching goal of CPTAC is to improve our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent cancer. To achieve this goal in a scientifically rigorous manner, the NCI launched CPTAC to systematically identify proteins that derive from alterations in cancer genomes and related biological processes, and provide this data with accompanying assays and protocols to the public.	https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/contributed-genomic-data-cancer-research/clinical-proteomic-tumor-analysis-consortium-cptac#:~:text=The%20National%20Cancer%20Institute's%20Clinical,and%20genome%20analysis%2C%20or%20proteogenomics.
