Molecular Pathological Epidemiology of CRC	CIDR CRC	Colorectal cancer, the second most commonly diagnosed cancer is a biologically heterogeneous disease. To characterize the molecular attributes of colorectal tumors, we conducted targeted sequencing at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) on 4,518 tumor and matched normal DNA samples from the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). These consortia are based on cohort and population-based case-control studies.
