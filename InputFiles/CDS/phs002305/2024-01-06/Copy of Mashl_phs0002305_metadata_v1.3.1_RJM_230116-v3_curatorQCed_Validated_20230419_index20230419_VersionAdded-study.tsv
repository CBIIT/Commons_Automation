Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center	"This data set is a collection of patient specimens from common and rare cancers that have been developed into patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models at the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC). The goal of the PDTC is to develop and characterize PDX models, gaining insight into tumor biology, and validating biomarkers across all major tumor types. Pre-clinical experiments in these PDX models will be used to advance our ability to predict clinical responses to new molecularly targeted agents under development.
