Clinical data include demographics, diagnosis (classified according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3.2), stage, and biospecimen associated data. Tumors were sequenced with OncoPanel, a targeted next-generation DNA sequencing panel of up to 447 cancer genes for detection of single-nucleotide variants (SNV), insertions, and deletions, and copy number alterations (CNA), as well as selected intronic regions for up to 60 genes for the detection of structural variants (SV). </p><p>This dataset includes a patient and sample identifier (GENIE ID) that can be used to link the genomic data included in this dataset to additional longitudinal clinical cancer data on a subset of patients that was submitted to the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR).</p><p> </p>"	HMB	1	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002677
