study	phs002883	phs002883	Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI): NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH Precision Medicine Clinical Trial	"NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH is a cancer treatment clinical trial for children, teens, and young adults, aged 1 to 21 years, that is testing the use of precision medicine for childhood cancers. In this trial, young people with solid tumors that are not responding to treatment are assigned to an experimental treatment based on the genetic changes found in their tumors rather than on their type of cancer or cancer site. The genetic changes are found through genomic sequencing, which is a laboratory method used to determine the genetic makeup of cancer cells."	https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/clinical-trials/nci-supported/pediatric-match	Active	ec303fe3-0c90-5c79-b397-04db4b0ed823
