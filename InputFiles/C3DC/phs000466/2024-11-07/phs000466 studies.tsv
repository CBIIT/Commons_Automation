CCSK is a rare, aggressive kidney tumor that usually occurs in children younger than 3 years of age and little is known about the biology of this disease. There are 13 patient cases in the CCSK dataset, each with gene expression, methylation and comprehensive next-generation sequencing to include whole genome sequencing of tumor/normal pairs and mRNA-seq.
