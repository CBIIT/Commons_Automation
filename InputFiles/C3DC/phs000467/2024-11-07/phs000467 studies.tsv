The dataset includes 24 4S cases as well. Each fully characterized case has gene expression, tumor and paired normal copy number analyses, methylation and comprehensive next-generation sequencing to include whole genome and/or whole exome sequencing. A majority of these cases will also have mRNA-seq and methylation data available as well. There are additionally a large number of cases, both low and high risk, with partial molecular characterization to include some next generation and targeted Sanger sequencing making this a large and informative genomic dataset.
