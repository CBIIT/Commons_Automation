Rhabdoid tumors are a rare, very aggressive type of kidney tumor of infancy, and patients typically have a poor prognosis. Up to 40 patient cases of matched tumor and normal samples, as well as some established cell lines, will undergo whole genome sequencing, miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq, DNA methyl-seq and ChIP-seq to generate a comprehensive profile and hopefully facilitate the development of better therapeutic options for this tumor subtype.
