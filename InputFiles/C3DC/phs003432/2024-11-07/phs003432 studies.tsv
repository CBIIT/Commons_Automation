We profiled 40 T-ALL cases from the Children's Oncology Group AALL0434 clinical trial using CITE-seq/snATAC-seq, capturing a breadth of immunophenotypes, including early T-cell precursor (ETP) and near-ETP/non-ETP subtypes. By integrating analyses of T-ALL cells with the normal T-cell developmental trajectory, the study identified a specific subgroup of leukemia cells resembling bone marrow progenitors (BMP-like cells). These BMP-like cells were associated with treatment failure and poor overall survival in T-ALL patients. Overall, this study reveals comprehensive multiomic signatures for rapidly assessing risk and tailoring targeted treatment for high-risk T-ALL patients. </p>"	"GRU"	"1"	"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003432"	"Completed"
