In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 63 clinically annotated NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors, including 24 PN, 34 premalignant atypical neurofibromas, and 5 MPNSTs. These results improve the ability of identifying high-risk neurofibromas and provide a unique opportunity for early detection of MPNST. </p>"	"GRU"	"1"	"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003519"	"Completed"
