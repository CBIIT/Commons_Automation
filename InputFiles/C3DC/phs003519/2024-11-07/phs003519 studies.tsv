In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 63 clinically annotated NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors, including 24 PN, 34 premalignant atypical neurofibromas, and 5 MPNSTs. These results improve the ability of identifying high-risk neurofibromas and provide a unique opportunity for early detection of MPNST."
