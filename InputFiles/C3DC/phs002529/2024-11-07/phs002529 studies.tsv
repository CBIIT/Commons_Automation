These data include whole genome sequencing (generally, ~20x), whole exome sequencing (generally, ~300x), bulk RNA sequencing (generally, ~80 million reads), and single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing (>50,000 reads/cell). Additional phenotypic, pathologic, and genetic data, gathered clinically for these samples, are also provided."
