We propose to leverage this large portfolio of models across a diversity of diseases, along with the deep expertise of the team, to establish a NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) Research Team focused on pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas, renal tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) and other rare pediatric solid tumors."
