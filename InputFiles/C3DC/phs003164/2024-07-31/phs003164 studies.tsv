study	4ecc668a-4203-5749-90cc-5606d22f9a38	phs003164	phs003164	CCDI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program - Leukemia	"<p>The goal of this study is to molecularly characterize a large panel of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) previously established in immune-deficient mice. These PDXs are utilized as part of the NCI-funded Pediatric Preclinical In vivo Testing (PIVOT) program to identify novel agents and combinations. Biospecimen data include next-generation sequencing (RNAseq, whole exome sequencing, DNA copy number variation), whole-genome analysis of cytogenetic abnormalities, and DNA fingerprint for quality control. </p>"	GRU	1	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003164
