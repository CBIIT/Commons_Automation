These PDXs are utilized as part of the NCI-funded Pediatric Preclinical In vivo Testing (PIVOT) program to identify novel agents and combinations. Biospecimen data include next-generation sequencing (RNAseq, whole exome sequencing, DNA copy number variation), whole-genome analysis of cytogenetic abnormalities, and DNA fingerprint for quality control."
