Clinical, treatment and outcome data on 1,039 pediatric cancer patients whose molecular profile was characterized on OncoKids gene panel at Children's Hospital Los Angeles was abstracted and harmonized for submission to the NCI's Cancer Data Service. The OncoKids panel was designed to detect DNA mutations and amplification in almost 200 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, a limited number of pharmacogenomic targets and 1,700 disease-associated gene fusions at the RNA level. The panel encompasses the vast majority of FDA's relevant pediatric molecular target list, as well as additional genes associated with ultra-rare pediatric tumors. The final data elements included DNA/RNA sequence data, OncoKids test results, clinical data on demographics, diagnosis, comorbidity and adverse events and treatment data."
