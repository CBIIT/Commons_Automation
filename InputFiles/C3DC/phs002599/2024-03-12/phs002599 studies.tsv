This supplement data from the Beat AML program provides Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) and pediatric tumor specimens not previously released. These data include exome and RNA level characterization as well as analyses of ex vivo drug sensitivity. Collectively, this data can be leveraged to address clinical, genomic, transcriptomic and functional analyses of the biology of leukemia in pediatric and AYA populations."
