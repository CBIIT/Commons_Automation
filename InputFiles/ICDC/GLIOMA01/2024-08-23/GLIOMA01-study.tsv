study	CMCP	GLIOMA01		Comparative Molecular Life History of Spontaneous Canine and Human Gliomas	"Sporadic gliomas in companion dogs provide a window on the interaction between tumorigenic mechanisms and host environment. We compared the molecular profiles of canine gliomas with those of human pediatric and adult gliomas to characterize evolutionarily conserved mammalian mutational processes in gliomagenesis. Employing whole genome-, exome-, transcriptome- and methylation-sequencing of 81  canine gliomas, our cross-species comparative genomic analysis provides unique insights into glioma etiology and the chronology of glioma-causing somatic alterations, and rationalizes sporadic canine glioma as a preclinical model tailored to measuring treatment efficacies in patients with canine or human glioma. Here, we provide high-throughput multi-omics sequencing data in binary alignment map (BAM) format for the largest canine glioma cohort to date."
