study	CMCP	NA	STS01	Genomic/Transcriptomic Analysis of Canine Soft Tissue Sarcomas	"To differentiate common sub-types of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and understand their biological and clinical behavior, this study evaluated the transcriptomic, genomic, and immunogenomic profiles of 29 canine soft tissue sarcomas (STS).  Histologically, two sub-types of STS were included in this study, fibrosarcomas (FSA) and peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST). Gene expression profiles based on RNA sequencing clustered these tumors into a single PNST cluster and 3 FSA clusters. The PNST tumors were mostly grade 1 and 2 with few SNV variants, but recurrent copy number losses of RB1. Whole exome sequencing identified TP53 and KMT2D as the top two recurrently mutated genes with other identified driver mutations in cell cycle, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling pathways. Fusion analysis of RNA sequencing data identified several putative fusion gene drivers including PDGFB fusions with collagen genes in 13% of the FSA tumors. Both immunohistochemical and immunogenomic profiling identified a set of tumors with high infiltration of immune cells. MAP kinase pathway activation was only observed in the fibrosarcoma clusters, where 90% of the grade III tumors showed activation. This multi-omic analysis of STS tumors revealed groups with distinct genomic, transcriptomic, and immunogenomic profiles."	Genomics/Transcriptomics	2004-10-26	2004 - 2023	000019	Unrestricted
