study	COP	COTC021	COTC021	Evaluation of Orally Administered mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin in Dogs in the Adjuvant Setting with Osteosarcoma	"A prospective clinical trial conducted in dogs with osteosarcoma through the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium (COTC). This was a fixed Standard of Care (SOC) followed by adjuvant orally-administered rapamycin study in 152 dogs with osteosarcoma. The study period included the entirety of the dogs’ progression-free survival after diagnosis, amputation of the affected limb, administration of adjuvant carboplatin therapy, and 4 cycles of orally administered rapamycin therapy. Dogs were considered off-study at the time disease progression is detected. Biological samples were collected at amputation and throughout the course of the study. Results were compared to COTC022: A contemporaneous Controlled Study of the Standard of Care (SOC) in Dogs with Appendicular Osteosarcoma"	Clinical Trial		November 2015 to November 2019		Unrestricted
