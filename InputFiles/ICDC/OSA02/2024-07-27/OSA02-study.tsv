study	CMCP		OSA02	"Association of canine osteosarcoma outcomes with clinical, genomic mutation, and transcriptomic expression profiles."	"This data set contains samples from 3 different studies, DFI (Disease Free Interval, conducted between 2007 - 2010), Coxen (Co-Expression Extrapolation, completed in 2016) 1 and Coxen 2 (conducted between 2015 - 2018.  The purpose of DFI was to identify differentially expressed genes between tumors from patients that were metastasis free for either greater than 300 days or less than 100 days following treatment with amputation of the affected limb and chemotherapy with doxorubicin and/or a platinum-based therapy. The purpose of Coxen 1 was a retropespective study to generate gene expression algorithms that could discriminate patients that would respond well to treatment with doxorubicin or platinum based therapies.  Coxen 2 was a prospective clinical trial to apply the gene expression signatures identified in Coxen 1 to a cohort of dogs with osteosarcoma to determine if those gene expression signatures would improve patient responses to therapy."
