study	CMCP		UC01	Whole exome sequencing analysis of canine urothelial carcinomas without BRAF V595E mutation	"Molecular profiling studies have shown that 85% of canine urothelial carcinomas (UC) harbor an activating BRAF V595E mutation. This provides both a powerful diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target. We performed whole exome sequencing analysis of 28 UC specimens that do NOT harbor this mutation, to identify informative molecular markers for this subtype, and to compare mutation profiles with eight BRAF V595-positive specimens that were analyzed in parallel."
