study	PRECINCT		PRCNCT IL-15	Inhaled IL-15 Immunotherapy for Treatment of Lung Metastases 	"Because IL-15 possesses the ability to activate natural killer (NK) cells without stimulation of Tregs, we investigated whether inhaled recombinant human IL-15 (ihIL-15) therapy may be more successful than IL-2. The primary endpoints of this study were to identify toxicities, determine the maximum tolerated dose of ihIL-15 and identify immune correlates in dogs with metastatic osteosarcoma (OSA) or melanoma (Mel) undergoing treatment with ihIL-15."	Clinical Trial			1001	Unrestricted
