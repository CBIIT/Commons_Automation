program	Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials	PRECINCT	The Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT) facilitates the performance of immunotherapy clinical trials in dogs with cancer and expedites the identification of immunological correlates of successful therapeutic responses.	"The mission of the Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT), supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute, is to provide infrastructure and oversight to a highly collaborative and interactive network of researchers and clinician scientists working to accelerate the application of next generation immunotherapies through comparative oncology. Pet dogs spontaneously develop cancers that share remarkable similarities in biology, genetics, treatment response and outcome to human patients. Evaluating next generation immunotherapies and combination immunotherapies in immune competent canine patients aims not only to provide more effective treatments for these pets but also unparalleled insight into response and response prediction through correlative biomarker discovery. This work will aid human clinical trial design and accelerate the translation of novel immunotherapies and immunotherapy protocols into the human clinic."	https://www.precinctnetwork.org/	1
