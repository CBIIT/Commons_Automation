study	CMCP		OSA04	A Transcriptomic Evaluation of Canine Osteosarcoma	"This study includes bulk transcriptomic sequencing of primary canine osteosarcoma and patient-matched normal bone in 7 dogs. Additionally, single-nuclei multiome (ATAC + Gene Expression) sequencing of a single tumor sample (which was also bulk sequenced) is included. Importantly, the normal bone samples (obtained from the phalange diaphysis - distal & distant from tumor) were depleted of marrow cavity contents and periosteum in order to isolate RNA that is primarily derived from cells embedded within the bone matrix.
