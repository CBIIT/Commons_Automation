study	CMCP		ORGANOIDS01	Characterization of Healthy and Urothelial Carcinoma Canine Organoids for Applications in Personalized Medicine and Translational Research	"Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) is associated with an extremely poor survival rate of only 40% at 5 years follow-up, which, importantly, has not improved over the last 10 years. Two important factors that contribute to poor treatment outcomes are (1) the phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity of MIBC, which limits the translational value of some rodent models to evaluate therapeutic drug efficacy, and (2) the time it takes to test novel drugs and combinations of drugs in clinical trials for MIBC. As opposed to mice, dogs with spontaneously occurring bladder cancer have been shown to be a highly relevant model for human MIBC. This is highlighted by the fact that canine MIBC presents with very similar molecular features, tumor heterogeneity and subtypes, as well as clinical and metastatic behavior as humans. Therefore, canine MIBC constitutes an ideal preclinical study population to evaluate novel therapeutic options for patients with bladder cancer. To assess the strengths and limitations of the organoid model, we first utilized adult stem cell-derived 3D canine organoids from healthy donors with novel lines grown from the endometrium, lung, and pancreas, in addition to previously described organoid lines derived from the liver and urinary bladder. Furthermore, these healthy donor-derived organoid lines were compared to their tissue of origin. Then, urine-derived 3D canine organoids from patients with urothelial carcinoma were cultured and characterized using immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq, and whole-genome sequencing. The premise of this study is therefore that future therapeutic leads for MIBC can be screened ex vivo using canine organoids to identify the most promising drug candidates. Subsequently, these novel therapeutics could be tested in vivo in dogs with bladder cancer prior to clinical testing in human patients with MIBC. Finally, the characterization of healthy canine organoid lines from various organs can be utilized to study various diseases, drugs, and biological phenomena."
