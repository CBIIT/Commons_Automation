study	PCCR		UBC03	Transcriptomic analyses of early stage bladder cancer in Scottish Terriers detected through screening	"When bladder cancer is detected earlier in the disease course, it is expected to be associated with less genetic diversity, fewer active drug resistance pathways, and more competent host immune responses compared to those associated with more advanced cancer.  There is strong interest in confirming these expectations and exploiting the findings to improve cancer therapy. The strong breed-associated risk for naturally-occurring invasive urothelial carcinoma in dogs offers unique opportunities for this research. In this study, RNA-sequencing analyses were performed on early urothelial carcinoma detected through bladder cancer screening in 16 Scottish Terriers with no clinical signs or urinary dysfunction, with comparison to later urothelial carcinoma in 12 Scottish Terriers reported in UBC02, and to muscle-invasive bladder cancer in humans in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Scottish Terriers were studied because they have a 20-fold higher risk of urothelial carcinoma than dogs in other breeds. The transcriptomic signatures found in the study included druggable targets such as EGFR and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, with very similar findings between canine and human invasive urothelial carcinoma, especially within the luminal and basal molecular subtypes. Marked transcriptomic differences were noted between early and later canine tumors, particularly within the luminal subtype. The study results have been published, and the RNA-sequencing data and clinical data are provided here. "	Transcriptomics	2/3/2014	2014-06-18 - present	000010	Unrestricted
