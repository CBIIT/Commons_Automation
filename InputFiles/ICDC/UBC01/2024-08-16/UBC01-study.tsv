study	PCCR	UBC01		Antitumor Activity and Molecular Effects of Vemurafenib in Dogs with BRAF-mutant Bladder Cancer	A phase I/II clinical trial of vemurafenib was performed in dogs with naturally-occurring invasive urothelial carcinoma which harbored the BRAF V595E mutation (canine homologue of the BRAF V600E mutation in human cancer). The purpose was to determine the suitability of the canine cancer in serving as a model to improve BRAF-targeted therapies in humans. The objectives were to determine the: (1) safety and maximum tolerated dose of vemurafenib, (2) pharmacokinetic profile, (3) antitumor activity and clinical case follow-up, and (4) analysis of RNA-seq data from tumor samples collected prior to vemurafenib, at approximately one month into treatment, and at relapse. The findings confirmed good initial antitumor activity followed by consistent relapse in the dogs, similar to that reported in BRAF-driven cancer in humans, and provided new information concerning some of the mechanisms involved in drug sensitivity and resistance.
