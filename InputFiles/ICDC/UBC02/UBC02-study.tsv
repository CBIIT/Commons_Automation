study	PCCR	UBC02		Basal and Luminal Molecular Subtypes in Naturally-Occurring Canine Urothelial Carcinoma Are Associated With Tumor Immune Signatures and Dog Breed	Molecular subtypes defined by transcriptomic analyses are associated with treatment response and cancer behavior in invasive urinary bladder cancer in humans. Studies in animal models are needed to test new treatment strategies in the context of molecular subtypes. The purpose of this study was to confirm the presence of the molecular subtypes in naturally-occurring canine invasive bladder cancer, and to determine clinical features and tumor characteristics associated with the subtypes. In RNA-seq analyses of 56 tumors, 29 tumors were luminal, and 27 tumors were basal subtype. Basal tumors were associated with greater immune infiltration and more aggressive tumor behavior, as occurs in humans. Luminal tumors were strongly associated with dog breed. The findings support the value of canine invasive bladder cancer as a relevant model for the human condition.	Genomics	2015-09-16	June 2017 - October 2020	000005	Unrestricted
