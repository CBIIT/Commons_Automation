"The Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) was established as an NCI basic science cancer center in 1978. As such, the PCCR's mission focuses on basic discovery - discovery that is the foundation through which the PCCR fosters innovative cancer solutions. The PCCR takes advantage of a strong transdisciplinary environment, and integrates Purdue core strengths in engineering, veterinary medicine, nutrition science, chemistry, medicinal chemistry, pharmacy, structural biology, and biological sciences, to drive collaborative research leading to innovative cancer solutions. As a matrix center, PCCR leadership draws on core capabilities through more than 100 members from 20+ academic departments and 7 colleges across Purdue. The Purdue Comparative Oncology Program in the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine is very well integrated into the PCCR. Ongoing work includes defining naturally-occurring canine cancer models of human cancer at the clinical, pathological, and genomic level; studying genetic and environmental factors leading to cancer; and conducting canine clinical trials of existing agents and new discoveries emerging from the PCCR and other institutions."	https://www.purdue.edu/cancer-research/index.php	3
