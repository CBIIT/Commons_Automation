study	CMCP	MGT01		Molecular Homology and Differences Between Spontaneous Canine Mammary Cancer and Human Breast Cancer	"Like human breast cancer, mammary cancers in companion dogs are naturally occurring, heterogeneous, and one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in females.  Canine mammary cancer also has many molecular homologies to its human counterpart, making it a profound and yet relatively understudied model for human cancers. We set out to comprehensively characterize 12 spontaneous canine mammary tumors at the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic levels to evaluate their molecular similarities and differences from human breast cancers. Here, we show this comparative analysis conducted using whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, RNA-seq, immunohistochemical staining, and array comparative genomic hybridization experiments."
