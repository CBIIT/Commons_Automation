program	Comparative Oncology Program	COP	The COP is a core resource for CCR investigators who are interested in the use of comparative cancer models.	In 2003, the National Cancer Institute's Center for Cancer Research (CCR) launched the Comparative Oncology Program (COP) to help researchers better understand the biology of cancer and to improve the assessment of novel treatments for humans by treating pet animals with naturally occurring cancer, giving these animals the benefit of cutting-edge research and therapeutics. All COP-sponsored clinical trials and scientific studies are grouped under the COP program within ICDC to provide researchers centralized access to the clinical and molecular data generated by them and thereby support further analysis.		1
